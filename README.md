###### OBJECTIVE 
We have an exciting opportunity for a revision project that will help tou to  reinforce and recap all the concepts we've covered.
 We're working on a Task Manager application, focusing on CRUD operations, using React, Express.js, and either MySQL or MongoDB.
{
    id: 1,
    title: "Task Title",
    description: "Task Description",
    status: "To Do",
    // Add any other relevant fields as needed
}

### Project Overview:

# Tech Stack: 
React, Express.js, Database (MySQL or MongoDB)

# Full-Stack Integration:

 Connect React to Express.js and integrate with a database.

### Project Idea: Task Manager Application

# Project Stack:

Frontend: React.js
Backend: Express.js
Database: MySQL or MongoDB (You can choose either)
### Project Description:
Build a simple Task Manager application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. The application should have a clean and user-friendly interface.

### User Stories:

## 1 -As a user, I want to see a list of all tasks:
When I visit the application, I should see a list of tasks with their details (title, description, status, etc.).
Each task in the list should have options to edit or delete.

## 2-As a user, I want to add a new task:
On the main page, there should be a button or form that allows me to add a new task.
When I click on the "Add Task" button or submit the form, a new task should be added to the list.

## 3-As a user, I want to edit an managable task:
Each task in the list should have an "Edit" option.
When I click on the "Edit" option, I should be taken to a page or modal where I can modify the task details.
After editing, the task details should be updated in the list

## 4-As a user, I want to delete a task:
Each task in the list should have a "Delete" option.
When I click on the "Delete" option, the task should be removed from the list.
## 5-As a user, I want to search for a task by name:

Provide a search functionality allowing users to find tasks by name.
Upon searching, display the matching task(s) in the list.

## 6-As a user, I want to mark a task as completed:

Provide an option for users to mark tasks as completed.
Completed tasks should be visually distinct from active tasks in the list.
## 7-As a user, I want to prioritize tasks:

Allow users to assign priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low) to tasks.
Display tasks in the list according to their priority level.
## 8-As a user, I want to categorize tasks:

Enable users to assign categories or tags to tasks (e.g., work, personal, urgent).
Provide filtering options based on categories/tags to view specific groups of tasks.
